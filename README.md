# GD-dev-tools
A set of development tools that I use in nearly every Godot 4 project.

Things are still very janky so use at your own risk.

## Credits
The logging aspect of this project is partially based on [Log.gd](https://github.com/russmatney/log.gd) by [Russell Matney](https://github.com/russmatney). It is an awesome addon that is much better at logging than this project is! Go use it instead.
